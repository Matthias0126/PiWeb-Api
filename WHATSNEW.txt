 New Features
==========================================


Supported by DataService API-Version >= 1.2
-------------------------------------------

- Possibility to authenticate by OAuth (only for PiWeb Cloud)

- DeleteMeasurements method was extended by Parameter aggregation and deep.
<<Aggregation>> indicates if all mesurements or only normal or aggregated 
mesaurments hould be deleted.
<<Deep>> indicates if only measurements for the curent part specified by 
partPath or also all measurements of child parts should be deleted

- ServiceInformation object contains CatalogTimestamp property that specifies 
when catalogs were modifeid last time

- Measurements can be deleted by part uuid, now. DeleteMeasurements methods are 
obsolete as they have been replaced by DeleteMeasurementsByPartPath, 
DeleteMeasurementsByPartUuids und DeleteMeasurementsByUuid.

- WrappedServerException includes not only status code but complete HttpRequestMessage
and HttpResponseMessage

- WrappedServerException property Error includes more exception details

- New methods to check usage of attributes (CheckAttributeUsage) and usage of catalog 
entries (ChechCatalogEntryUsage)

- GetCatalogs method was replaced by new methods GetAllCatalogs and GetCatalog which 
returns catalog for a certain catalog uuid

- Possibility to filter search by database fields was added (6691)

- Simplification: Removed multiple constructors of DataServcieRestClient for better clarity

- DataServcieRestClient now supports ILoginRequestHandler parameter for dynamic login requesting 

- GetMeasurements and GetValues methods can additionally be restricted by partUuids parameter

- Added method GetDistinctMeasurementAttributeValues that fetches a list of measurement attribute 
values of a certain attribute for a given part. The search operation can be parameterized using the 
specified by a filter. If this filter is empty, all values for the specified key will be fetched.

- Removed possibility to stream response for GetMeasurements and GetMeasurementValues as it work not 


Supported by RawDataService API-Version >= 1.2
----------------------------------------------

- On fetching raw data information it is possible to pass a filter, now.

- Simplification: Removed multiple constructors of RawDataServcieRestClient for better clarity

- RawDataServcieRestClient now supports ILoginRequestHandler parameter for dynamic login requesting 


Supported by DataService API-Version >= 1.3
-------------------------------------------

- GetCharacteristics: Removed parameter partUuids and introduced GetCharactersitcisByUuid method, which 
allows fetching multiple characteristics by their uuid in one call.

- When fetching the last n measurements, n is now represented by an integer value instead of short 
which allows fetching more than 32768 items.


Supported by DataService API-Version >= 1.4
-------------------------------------------

- GetMeasurements and GetValues methods can be restricted by primary measurement keys which 
are used for joining measurements accross multiple parts on the server side


==========================================
 Bugfixes
==========================================

- Order did not work on fetching measurements or values

- Deleting parts or characteristics did not work as expected

- On deleting all raw data entries for a certain entity by using particular 
method DeleteAllRawDataForPart, DeleteAllRawDataForCharacteristic, 
DeleteAllRawDataForMeasurement or DeleteAllRawDataForValue not all but 
only first entry was deleted

- Implemented handling for possible UriTooLong exception due to too many parameters

- Versioning entries can be created on creating parts and characteristics if 
flag <<versioningEnabled>> is set to true, now.

- DataServiceRestClient method DeleteAllParts methods did not work as ecpected.

- DataServiceRestClient method DeleteCatalogs did not work as expected.

- Renamed DataServiceRestClient method UpdateAttributeDefinition to UpdateAttributeDefinitions.

- On creating a catalog entry the key is initially set to -1 instead of 0. Previous behavior may
lead to unexpected behavior by possibly overwriting an aleready exiting entry.
